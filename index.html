    <p class="para">This is my first time outside of the states and it was worth the trip. Besides me escaping my family I have the opportunity to learn about a different culture and a completely different scholastic system.While we are studying different aspects of Welsh Culture I think that the most interesting is the folklore and a mix of the traditions. While a lot of myths in other cultures present themselves as an edited true story, Welsh people are not afraid to admit it is all made up. Something about knowing it is all fantasy makes it more intriguing. I have been enjoying the site seeing, the bonding, and the traveling. Traveling presented itself as a minor challenge as I am used to walking and taking the bus in NYC. Speaking of traveling, I enjoyed the places we have <a href="#target">already visited</a> and looking forward to so much more. A surprise to me is that the food is not as bad as everyone says (granted I have not had traditional foods, but I am glad there are options). </p>
